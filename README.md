# BDR_cadence

BDR Cadence is a sales tool that helps salespeople plan and forecast their outreach activities using a pre-defined sequence of
email, call, and LinkedIn messages. The tool takes inputs for the number of new prospects per day and the forecast period,
and calculates the required number of emails, calls, and LinkedIn messages needed to reach the specified targets.

It's implemented in Python using Streamlit.
